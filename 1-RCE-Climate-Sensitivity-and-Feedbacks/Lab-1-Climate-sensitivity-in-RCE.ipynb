    "### Radiative-convective equilibrium as an idealized problem for climate\n",
    "\n",
    "Imagine a pot of water on a stove, heated from below. As the water in the bottom of the pot warms it becomes less dense than the water above it and rises, causing the water to overturn (circulate in the vertical). Cooling from the top can also cause an overturning circulation - this is what you see in a bowl of miso soup. Any temperature profile in which deeper water is warmer than shallow water is \"unstable\" in this way, and will mix in the vertical. The vertical water motions are called \"convection\". \n",
    "\n",
    "The earth's atmosphere differs from a bowl of miso soup in three important ways (for the purposes of this discussion). \n",
    "\n",
    "First, the atmosphere is compressible, meaning that the pressure decreases roughly exponentially with distance from the surface. Conservation of energy means that the temperature of the air also has to decrease with height. This means that the condition of stability isn't \"is the air below a given location warmer/less dense than the air at the location\" but rather \"will the air below **be**  warmer/less dense if it's raised to the location?\" (In the atmospheric sciences it's common to use a \"potential temperature\" that accounts for this energy-conserving relationship between pressure and temperature.) \n",
    "\n",
    "Second, the atmosphere contains water vapor. The maximum amount of water vapor is controlled by temperature. When air cools enough, then, the water vapor condenses, which gives off energy. This means that the temperature profile in which water is condensing (i.e. inside a cloud) cools less rapidly with height than does dry air. Two consequences are a) that convection in the atmosphere is a balances of small regions of strong, upward motion in which water is condensing (clouds!) surrounded by large regions of gentle downward motion with no clouds. A second is that the stabiity condition is phrased with respect to motions in which water is condensing - a less stringent threshold than a dry atmosphere. \n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, unlike soup cooled from the top surface, the atmosphere cools throughout its depth, because water vapor is an effective emitter of longwave radiation. \n",
    "\n",
    "**Radiative-convective equilibrium** is very simple representation of the earth's climate, in which the radiative cooling of the atmosphere is balanced by convective motions. "

    "### Background on konrad \n",
    "\n",
    "`konrad` is a modern implementation of a single-column radiative-convective equilibrium model. The convective motions aren't explicit - instead, as the cooling makes the atmosphere unstable, the temperature and moisture profiles are adjusted to reflect vertical mixing in an energy-conserving way to maintain a stable profile. \n",
    "\n",
    "In other sections of the course you'll be using very small models for which it will be straightforward enough to read the entire implementation. `konrad` is more involved so the focus will be on framing and answering questions and interpreting the results. \n",
    "\n",
    "The model's technical documention -- lists of all the components and functions -- is available on [ReadTheDocs](https://konrad.readthedocs.io). The konrad authors' [\"How to konrad\"](https://atmtools.github.io/konrad) Jupyter book is a tutorial in using the model. All the questions we asked below are found in the tutorial but you should arrive at your own answers. "
