In RCE this is determined by the \"moist adiabatic lapse rate\" $\\Gamma_m(p)$ meaning the variation of temperature with height in a energy-conserving parcel of air in which water is condensing. $\\Gamma_m(p)$ depends on temperature and pressure through the dependence of the maximum (saturation) water vapor mixing ratio on temperature. \n",
    "\n",
    "The \"lapse rate feedback\" $\\lambda_{\\Gamma}$ is the change in $N$ due to changes in $\\Gamma(p)$ - in other words, the change in $N$ due to non-uniform warming of the atmosphere. \n",

    "The water vapor feedback $\\lambda_{wv}$, the change in $N$ caused by changes in the distribution of water vapor, is so strongly controlled by temperature that it's easiest to consider $\\lambda_{wv}$ and $\\lambda_{\\Gamma}$ together. \n",

    "As discussed by [Isaac Held and Karen Shell (2012)](https://10.1175/JCLI-D-11-00721.1) (an excerpt of which is [below](#held-shell)), the magnitude of the lapse rate and water feedbacks depend on which state variable is used to represent water vapor, which is equivalent to choosing a reference response. If we characterize water vapor by its _absolute concentration_, feedbacks are measured against a world in which absolute concentration doesn't change with temperature, meaning that relative humidity decreases with warming. If we characterize water vapor by its _relative concentration_ or _relative humidity_ (relative being measured with respect to temperature-depednent saturation), then the feedbacks are measured in a world in which warmer is also wetter. \n",
