As noted [above](#feedbacks-in-rce), he atmospheric temperature feedback $\\lambda_{T_a}$ can be further decomposed into an atmospheric Planck feedback $\\lambda_{Pl}$ associated with vertically uniform warming of the same magnitude as the surface temperature change, and a lapse-rate feedback $\\lambda_{\\Gamma}$ associated with vertically non-uniform warming. \n",
    "\n",
    "In the atmospheric sciences the term \"lapse rate\" describes the rate of change of temperature with pressure $\\Gamma(p) = \\frac{dT}{dp}$. The connection of lapse rate to feedback arises because, in RCE, the lapse rate is set by the theoretical \"moist adiabatic lapse rate\" $\\Gamma_m(p)$, meaning the variation of temperature with height in a energy-conserving parcel of air in which water is condensing. $\\Gamma_m(p)$ depends on temperature and pressure through the dependence of the maximum (saturation) water vapor mixing ratio on temperature. \n",

    "#### Water vapor feedbacks\n",

    "As discussed by [Isaac Held and Karen Shell (2012)](https://10.1175/JCLI-D-11-00721.1) (an excerpt of which is [below](#held-shell)), the magnitude of the lapse rate and water feedbacks depend on which state variable is used to represent water vapor, which is equivalent to choosing a reference response. If we characterize water vapor by its _absolute concentration_, feedbacks are measured against a world in which absolute concentration doesn't change with temperature, meaning that relative humidity decreases with warming. If we characterize water vapor by its _relative concentration_ or _relative humidity_ (relative being measured with respect to temperature-depednent saturation), then the feedbacks are measured in a world in which warmer is also wetter. \n",
