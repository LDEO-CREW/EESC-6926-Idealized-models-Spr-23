    "`konrad` is a modern implementation of a single-column radiative-convective equilibrium model. In other sections of the course you'll be using very small models for which it will be straightforward enough to read the entire implementation. `konrad` is more involved so the focus will be on framing and answering questions and interpreting the results. \n",

The konrad authors' [\"How to konrad\"](https://atmtools.github.io/konrad) Jupyter book is a tutorial in using the model. All the questions we asked below are found in the tutorial but you should arrive at your own answers. "
